# Predicting House Prices Using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project uses historical housing data to build a predictive model for estimating house prices.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle Housing Prices Dataset (train.csv)

## Techniques Used
- Data cleaning (Pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Linear Regression/ Lasso, Ridge)
- Model Evaluation (MSLE)

## Results
- The best-performing model achieved an MSLE of 0.14.
